# scratch

A Javascript in browser scratch pad, with module resolution

This project is a browser-based coding environment that uses;

- Monaco for the coding environment.
- Eval() inside an IFRAME for isolated and secure coding contexts.
- Unpkg.com for fetching package contents.
- Redux + Thunk for handling state.
- ESBuild for quickly building user code and packages into a single index.js
- Uses IndexedDB to preserve code and package downloads
